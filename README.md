### Question 3
Correct Answer: age 16

The content enclosed inside of the parentheses will be logged to the console. Information within quotation marks will be displayed as it is. The number 16 has been stored within the age variable, so it will be logged to the console after the word age. The comma is just there to separate the two pieces of information, so it will not be logged to the console because it is not included within the quotation marks.

### Question 6
Correct Answer: '''
function sayHi() {
    document.getElementById("my-paragraph").innerHTML = "Hi, there!";
}
'''
